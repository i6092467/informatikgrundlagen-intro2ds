    "What you see here is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Like CodeExpert, Jupyter Notebook is an interactive programming environment for Python and other programming languages. While CodeExpert makes it easier for you to get started with programming, Jupyter Notebook is widely used in practice to share your work with others and interactively process, visualize, and explore data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook combines code, output, and comments into a fully editable document (with a .ipynb extension). That means you can change the code and the comments to adapt the output (print output, plots, etc.) accordingly. Jupyter Notebook can also be exported as a PDF or HTML file.\n",

In Markdown cells, the text can be formatted, e.g. by adjusting the <span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS\">font</span> and <span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">font size</span>, and even links and images can be embedded. The [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) can be used for this.\n",
